In the world of data-related jobs, it’s crucial to have a strong grasp of data pipelining. Data pipelines are like the heart and soul of efficient data handling,
ensuring that information moves smoothly from where it’s stored to where it’s needed. When it comes to tools for managing this process, Apache Airflow shines
as one of the most favored and widely used options.

Airflow provides the backbone for orchestrating tasks, but what truly sets it apart is its extensibility and compatibility with a wide range of companion programs.
In this article, we explore how Apache Airflow seamlessly integrates with various tools, including SODA, Astro, Comos, DBT, and many more, to help you build efficient
and robust data pipelines.
